## Project Overview
The JCU Gym Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline gym registration and management at James Cook University (JCU). 
The system caters to two user groups: Gym Users and Administrators. Gym Users can register online, book gym sessions, and access AI-powered personalized workout plans. Administrators can manage user registrations, monitor gym usage statistics, and generate usage reports in PDF or CSV format. 
Built with modern web technologies (React, Node.js, Express, MySQL) and deployable on AWS, 
the system ensures a user-friendly interface, robust database management, and scalability. The project follows agile development principles, with iterative sprints to deliver functional components aligned with user stories.

## Project Goals
Deliver Core Functionality: Implement all specified user stories, including user registration (3 days), session booking (3 days), AI-powered workout plans (4 days), user registration management (5 days), gym session monitoring (7 days), and usage report generation (6 days).

Modern Technology Stack: Utilize React for a responsive GUI, Node.js/Express for the backend, MySQL for a relational database, and AWS for potential cloud deployment to meet rubric requirements for modern tools and cloud services.

Agile Development: Follow agile iterative development with 2-week sprints, ensuring incremental delivery and client feedback after each iteration, as per the rubric.

Comprehensive Documentation: Create detailed GitHub Pages with UML diagrams (Gliffy), database schemas (GenMyModel), UI prototypes (Ninjamock), and testing plans to achieve exemplary technical writing and design documentation.

Robust Testing: Implement unit tests (using Jest) and acceptance testing for all features, ensuring the delivered implementation matches the planned requirements.

Version Control Excellence: Leverage GitHub for version control, with clear commit histories and branch management to demonstrate exemplary use of development tools.

## Team Roles
James (Frontend Lead):
Responsibilities: Lead the development of the React-based frontend, including user registration, session booking, and AI workout plan interfaces. 
Design UI prototypes using Ninjamock and ensure a responsive, user-friendly GUI with Tailwind CSS.
Contribution: Implement React components, integrate API calls with the backend, and document UI design on GitHub Pages.


Min Khant Kyaw (Backend Lead):
Responsibilities: Oversee Node.js/Express backend development, including API endpoints for registration, booking, and admin functionalities. 
Configure MySQL database and ensure seamless data operations.
Contribution: Write and test backend logic, manage database schema, and document API endpoints and database design using GenMyModel.


May Thin Htet (Testing and Documentation Lead):
Responsibilities: Lead testing efforts, including unit tests (Jest) and acceptance testing for all user stories. Coordinate documentation for GitHub Pages, including UML diagrams (Gliffy), testing plans, and tool usage.
Contribution: Develop test cases, validate feature functionality, and ensure high-quality technical writing in the README and GitHub Pages.


Nay Thar Htet (DevOps and Deployment Lead):
Responsibilities: Manage version control (GitHub), set up CI/CD pipelines, and explore AWS deployment (EC2 for backend, RDS for MySQL). Ensure smooth integration between frontend and backend.
Contribution: Configure project repository, handle AWS setup, and document deployment steps and development tools used..
