## Project Overview
Purpose

The “MyClean” project aims to develop a website, desktop, or mobile application to streamline booking management for individual cleaners and cleaning companies while providing an intuitive platform for end-users to book cleaning services. The app is free for end-users, with revenue generated by selling the platform to service providers or through other monetization models, revolutionizing the cleaning service industry with efficient, user-focused technology.

Objectives

1. Deliver a scalable, user-friendly application that enables service providers to manage bookings, schedules, payments, and client communications effectively.

2. Provide end-users with a seamless interface to book, track, and review cleaning services.

3. Incorporate modern tools and cloud services (e.g., AWS) to achieve a high-distinction (HD) grade, ensuring innovation, reliability, and performance.

4. Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with core features, iteratively enhanced based on user feedback.

## Scope

Included:

1. Core features for service providers: booking management (calendar integration, scheduling, reminders), payment processing (mock interface for credit card payments), client communication (in-app messaging, notifications), profile management, and analytics.

2. Core features for end-users: easy booking interface, service tracking, payment options, reviews/ratings, and customer support.

3. Modern database (e.g., MySQL or Amazon RDS) for data management.

4. Modern GUI (web: React/Angular; mobile: Swift/Kotlin) for responsive, accessible user experience.

5. Cloud services (e.g., AWS EC2, S3, Cognito) for hosting, storage, and authentication.

6. Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) such as advanced matching algorithms, eco-friendly options, or AI-powered recommendations.
