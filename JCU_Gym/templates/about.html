            <h1> Common Exercises </h1>
            <p> The following are common exercises that we
                encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Burpee</dt>
                    <dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and
                    endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your
                    hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then
                    jump up from a squatted position. </dd>
                    <dt>Plank</dt>
                    <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up
                    position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you
                    can. </dd>
                    <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
                    <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the
                    floor in a push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch as
                    quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
